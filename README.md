# Hey, I'm Jayant 👋

I **explain AI by building it from scratch**. No frameworks, no complexity - just clear code and beautiful visualizations.

Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

## 🎓 Build AI From Scratch Series

Learning modern AI by implementing the fundamentals in minimal code.

### Part 1: Foundational Components (1990s-2010s)

The building blocks that bridge micrograd and modern transformers:

**Grand Total: 14 repos, ~3050 lines teaching AI from RNNs to modern LLMs**

Each repo includes:
- Minimal, readable code (no frameworks)
- Beautiful visualizations
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks
- Step-by-step tutorials

## 🎯 Why I Built This

Most AI tutorials either:
- Use frameworks (hiding the complexity)
- Or are too mathematical (losing clarity)

**I wanted to see the actual mechanisms** - so I built them from scratch.

The goal: Make AI accessible by showing how simple the core concepts really are.
